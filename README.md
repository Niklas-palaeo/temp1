# Introduction

Oysters play a pivotal role in the health and productivity of marine ecosystems. Their unique ability to filter water, provide habitat, and contribute to nutrient cycling makes them invaluable in establishing ecological baselines for sustainable aquaculture practices. The burgeoning field of oyster restoration for aquaculture has recognized the potential of these bivalves in mitigating environmental impacts, enhancing biodiversity, and promoting ecosystem resilience. However, the establishment of ecological baselines is a complex task, requiring a comprehensive understanding of oyster biology, population dynamics, and their interactions with the surrounding environment. Recent studies have begun to explore the use of historical oyster reefs as potential baselines, providing insights into the natural state of these ecosystems prior to significant human intervention.

Here were use the information from over 2,000 analysed oyster shells dating to the mid-Holocene, 

## The importance of oysters

Oysters, as ecosystem engineers, are able to significantly influence the ecological dynamics and economic sustainability in Coastal regions, including the European Atlantic coast and in particular estuarine areas. These organisms render unique ecological services and enhance the seafood industry and ecotourism. 

The pivotal role of oysters in these ecosystems is primarily due to their robust filtration capacity. Each oyster can filter up to 200 litres of water daily, serving as an organic particle and pollutant extractor. This process improves water transparency, encourages aquatic plant photosynthesis, and curbs eutrophication by limiting nitrogen and phosphorus. This restricts harmful algal bloom development and subsequent hypoxia, thereby maintaining a biologically diverse and healthy marine environment.

Moreover, oysters' tendency to establish reefs contributes to ecological complexity and biodiversity by providing crucial habitats for various marine species. These reefs, acting as breeding and nursery areas, support ecosystem stability and resilience. The physical presence of reefs also mitigates shoreline erosion and acts as a storm buffer, which is increasingly important considering climate change.

Economically, the oyster sector is vital to the seafood industry in these regions. In the UK, for example, oysters significantly contribute to culinary traditions and economic health. Oyster reef conservation and restoration also spur ecotourism, offering additional revenue for local communities. Nevertheless, the industry's viability relies on maintaining healthy ecosystems, which face threats like overharvesting, disease, pollution, and habitat destruction.

The vital ecological and economic roles of oysters necessitate strategic conservation and sustainable management efforts in these regions to preserve their ecological functions and ensure the longevity of supported human industries, thus balancing ecological health with human prosperity.

  

## Overfishing and climate change

Historically abundant oysters have seen considerable declines globally, due to overfishing and climate change. In particular European industrial-scale harvesting in the 19th and early 20th centuries critically reduced oyster populations of the North Sea.

Overfishing has diminished both the size and quantity of oysters and additionally modified oyster reef structure, impacting their ecological roles and benefits to other marine species.

Climate change intensifies these effects through elevated sea temperatures, ocean acidification, and frequent extreme weather events.

These historical and ongoing stresses have altered the modern baseline of oyster populations, consequently modifying restoration targets. This means that our perception of a healthy oyster population is based on a significantly depleted baseline. Hence, it is essential to incorporate historical baselines and the accumulative impacts of human activities when setting restoration goals.

## Decline of oyster populations

The decline of oyster populations in the Western Baltic Sea, the UK's coastal regions, and the European Atlantic Coast has elicited significant ecological and economic concern. Over the last century, these regions have faced a marked depletion of native oyster populations. Specifically, Ostrea edulis, commonly known as the European flat oyster, has experienced a dramatic decline. 

  

### From Heike Lotze 2005

The dominant feature of the Wadden Sea are its softsediment tidal flats. A century ago, however, complex, three-dimensional habitats were provided by oyster banks. These diversified the Wadden Sea landscape and provided diverse habitats for a variety of species which depended on hard substratum, protection or food supply. For example, oyster banks once supported rich communities of sponges, sea anemones, hydroids, worms, sea urchins and other species (Reise 1990). Most habitat-building species were heavily exploited or destroyed directly or indirectly by fisheries during the 20th century. With the loss of their hosts, associated species disappeared as well (Reise et al. 1989).

Because of their reef-formingand filtration capacity, depletion of oystersreduced the ecosystem_s ability to provide highwater quality and complex habitats.

Plentiful sea moss stands used to be common on oyster banks and mussel shells, but were dredged and marketed for decoration purposes until the 1950s (Fig. 4; Reise et al. 1989; Michaelis and Reise 1994).

  

## Restoration efforts

In light of these challenges, several restoration and repopulation efforts are currently underway. The Native Oyster Restoration Alliance (NORA) and the European Union's Horizon 2020 program have initiated projects aimed at rebuilding the lost oyster reefs and enhancing the population of native oysters in these regions.

NORA, in particular, has undertaken various initiatives across Europe, including the UK and the Baltic Sea region. These initiatives encompass breeding programs, reef restoration projects, and disease management strategies. In the UK, a notable project is the Solent Oyster Restoration Project, which aims to restore five million oysters in the Solent straits over five years.

The Horizon 2020 program has also funded multiple projects for oyster restoration, including the "RESTORE" project. This project seeks to rebuild self-sustaining populations of the European flat oyster across its former range. The initiative focuses on comprehensive restoration, incorporating oyster breeding, disease control, and reef construction.

These initiatives underscore the importance of a multidisciplinary approach that combines ecological, social, and economic aspects to restore oyster populations effectively. It is crucial to continue such endeavors to halt and reverse the decline of oyster populations in these historically important regions, ensuring the sustainability of these ecosystems and the industries they support.

## Challenges in establishing accurate baselines

Establishing reliable baselines for ecological restoration, such as that of the European flat oyster in the North Sea, is challenging when relying solely on modern reference data. This is due to the significant loss of oyster beds in areas like the German Bight and the severe degradation of remaining populations. The lack of comprehensive ecological baselines and dependable data on previous biogenic reef structures in the sublittoral zone further complicates the issue. Therefore, the success of restoration efforts, which aim to enhance ecosystem functions and services including biodiversity, habitat complexity, and water quality, is contingent upon the existence of suitable habitat conditions that support a stable oyster population.

  

## Shifting baseline syndrome

  

Shifting Baseline Syndrome refers to the phenomenon where changes in the environment are measured against personal or generational experiences, rather than against an objective standard. This can lead to a gradual acceptance of environmental degradation as each generation redefines what is "normal" or "natural" based on their experiences.

  

For example, consider the size of Northern European oysters. If overfishing and environmental changes have led to a significant reduction in oyster size over several generations, a young marine biologist might consider the smaller oysters they encounter as the standard size. They may not realize that oysters were significantly larger in the past. This perception shift can affect conservation efforts, as the targets for restoration may be set too low, aiming to achieve a "normal" that is already a state of degradation.

  

## Research on prehistoric and historic oyster fishing

Marine ecosystems are particularly susceptible to the shifting baseline syndrome. This is due to the largely unknown history of the marine ecosystem change.

To address this, researchers are increasingly turning to palaeoecological, archaeological, and historical evidence to understand this history. These studies are revealing the timing, direction, magnitude, and drivers of change within marine systems over past decades, centuries, and millennia. They are also shedding light on the profound impacts that our terrestrial and marine activities have had on the structure and functioning of marine ecosystems.

### 2012 zu Ermgassen et al.

Zu Ermgassen et al. (2012) conducted a century-long assessment of marine habitat-forming species, focusing on wild native oyster abundance in the United States. They compared historical (1878-1935) and recent (1968-2010) records, covering 39 and 51 estuaries respectively. The study revealed a 64% decline in oyster habitat extent and an 88% decrease in biomass, suggesting that current area measures may conceal substantial habitat degradation. The research underscores the profound influence of historical oyster fishing practices on the decline of U.S. oyster populations.

### 2005 Lotze

[Lotze](2005%20Lotze.pdf) (2005) summarises the historical data on Oyster fishing in the Wadden Sea (1770–1930) near Jutland, showing how annual oyster landings drastically increased to over 5 millions in the 1860s and then dropped to only a small fraction by the 1880 until their eventual collapse by the mid-20th century.

## Similar cases for north sea during 1800s?

### Hayes

Despite measures to protect Europe's oyster population from overexploitation, oyster fisheries have continued to decline dramatically. In fact, most natural populations of the European oyster went extinct in the North Sea during the 1940s. 

Nowadays, the only surviving natural population of *O. edulis* in the North Sea is found in large numbers in the Limfjord of Denmark. However, the majority of the population is found in commercial oyster farms on the European Atlantic coast. There are also very small and endangered natural populations in Norway and Sweden.

## Archaeological data

### Fariñas-Franco et al.

Using surveys and extensive dating of shell middens along the Dornoch Firth and Moray Firth system, Scotland, Fariñas-Franco et al. (2018) provide evidence for the prehistoric and historic presence of the European oyster. Their findings suggest a persistent O. edulis population in these areas until the 19th century. Given the suitable environmental conditions, these insights underscored the potential for successful oyster reintroduction, contributing to the ecological baseline necessary for future restoration efforts.

### 2016 Rick et al.

The use of prehistoric marine shell sizes has helped to better understand the sustainable long-term use of oyster beds. Rick et al (2016) used shells from Chesapeak Bay to show that Native American fisheries were focused on nearshore oysters and were likely harvested at a rate that was sustainable over centuries to millennia (∼3,500 y), despite changing Holocene climatic conditions and sea-level rise. Chesapeake Bay oyster populations have declined dramatically since then, making restoration and conservation challenging. The older Native American fisheries thus provide an important historical baseline for understanding oyster populations before overfishing.

### 2020 Thompson et al.

Thompson et al. (2020) investigated the structure of oyster reef ecosystems from initial human harvesting to the modern era by measuring 37,805 oyster shells from archaeological sites along the Atlantic Coast of the United States. They found that oyster size even increased over time and their size distributions across sites were nonrandom, which they attributed to processes related to Native American fishing rights and environmental variability. The study revealed that oyster fisheries were resilient and experienced multiple stable states over the last 5000 years before the 1900s, despite population growth and shifts in political organisation and changing economies.

## Leading to danish archaeological data 

The case studies above illustrate how archaeological information can provide an important perspective and substantial amounts of first-hand information on the long-term development of oyster catchments across millennia and changing environmental conditions.

  

##   Compare the research methods and findings

While oyster sizes are usually implied to be mainly affected by human harvesting pressure (studies above but more can be added), the caveat of environmental changes is also included. Alas, few attempts are made to quantify how much each factor (harvesting pressure and environmental changes) affects size. By adding the biological age of oysters as a measure, we can understand whether changes in their size are due to natural environmental changes or human activities. Like tree rings, oyster shells have yearly markers that help us know their age. If we find that both small and large shells are about the same age, it might mean that changes in the environment (e.g. changes in salinity, temperature, or nutrient availability) are causing the oysters to grow more slowly and stay small. However, if we find that the oysters are getting younger on average over time and also getting smaller, it could mean that people are harvesting them too much. When people harvest oysters heavily, they often take the larger, older ones or remove the oysters before they can grow large. This would result in the oysters in the area being, on average, both younger and smaller.

  

Since environmental changes have been shown to have a strong control on shellfish populations, it is crucial to quantify their influence, to better understand and integrate palaeo-ecological information derived from the oyster shells.

Being able to decouple both factors in the interpretation of oyster size, further improves our understanding of the sustainable use of oyster beds by pre-industrial coastal populations and emphasis their role as ecological archives in the guidance of modern economic uses of oyster beds.

## Describe our study

Here we summarise the largest archaeological growth rate dataset to date that comprises information from over 2,000 harvested oysters dating to a ~2,000 year period between 7400  and 5600 cal BP and overlapping the Mesolithic to Neolithic transition in Denmark. 

The dataset covers 19 sites from areas where wild oysters are still available (Limfjord) to areas where prehistoric coastlines are now submerged and information is coming from previously hidden sites of the Horsens Fjord.

This record is a good example because it covers socioeconomic and climatic transitions.

### Socioeconomic

* The Danish Mesolithic period, spanning from approximately 11,000 to 5,900 calBP (calibrated years before present), is in our dataset most notably represented by the Ertebølle culture. This period was characterised by a semi-sedentary hunter-fisher-gatherer lifestyle, with communities living along dynamic coastlines and exploiting marine resources. A key feature of the Ertebølle culture was its archaeological visibility in the form of shell middens. Shell middens, large accumulations of shell debris, are a testament to the wide use of molluscs and serve as significant archaeological evidence of their lifestyle. The Ertebølle culture was distributed across the coastal areas of present-day Denmark and parts of Northern Germany and Southern Sweden.

Transitioning into the Neolithic period, around 5,900 to 3,900 calBP, the Funnel Beaker culture became widespread in Denmark. Named after the characteristic shape of their pottery, this culture marked the advent of farming in Denmark. While the Funnel Beaker people continued to exploit marine resources, including shellfish, there was a noticeable shift towards agricultural practices and animal husbandry. The Funnel Beaker culture was widespread across much of Northern Europe, including present-day Denmark, Germany, and Sweden, and as far east as the Vistula River in Poland.

### Environmental

This period also covers dynamic environmental changes with likely impact on oyster populations ([2016 Lewis et al](2016%20Lewis%20et%20al.pdf) [2018 Larsen et al.](2018%20Larsen%20et%20al.pdf) ) as a result of sea-level changes and changes in agricultural practices. Lewis discuss salinity and temperature, which would both affect the growth rate of oysters as they can restrict the annual growing seasons. Lewis argue that higher sedimentation is a more likely scenario, for which the site Hjarnø is a good example, because here the shift coincides with sealevel changes that could have induced increased sedimentation.

The transition from Mesolithic to Neolithic is often accompanied by a switch from predominantly oyster deposits to cockle deposits, called the oyster-to-cockle shift. Cultural reasons for that shift as well as overwhelming harvesting pressure on oysters have been considered (Milner 20xx?). However, an earlier occurance of the shift already during the Mesolithic (Larsen 2018) means that an environmental rather than anthropogenic reason is more likely.

Because we include growth rates we are able to account for environmental factors as an influence on oyster sizes during this shift and can compare their influence to the one that harvesting pressure would have had.

  
  

## Our study summary and hypotheses

Our study aimed to investigate the dynamics of oyster populations and the influence of age and environmental factors. We hypothesised that the Neolithic period, characterised by reduced harvesting pressure, would lead to an increase in the age of oysters. Furthermore, we expected to observe a decrease in oyster sizes during the oyster-cockle-shift at the Mesolithic/Neolithic transition, excluding the Hjarnø region. This reduction in size could be attributed to either harvest pressure or environmental changes that made oysters less desirable. 

In analyzing the results, we discovered compelling evidence of the long-term stability of sustainable oyster harvesting practices. Our findings revealed that, on average, age accounted for approximately half of the variability in oyster size. Surprisingly, we did not observe a visible oyster-cockle-shift in growth rates. However, we did identify a size shift potentially related to harvest pressure in the earliest Mesolithic layers that have not been recovered. This finding provides broad evidence of sedentism during the Mesolithic period.

Our study sheds light on the intricate relationship between oyster age, environmental factors, and the sustainability of oyster harvesting practices. These findings contribute to our understanding of the historical dynamics of oyster populations and can inform conservation strategies for maintaining healthy oyster reefs in the future.

  

This work highlights the importance of growth rates in pre-industrial and long-term datasets that can inform research regarding the stability and sustainability of mollusc harvesting. 

  
  
  

# Results

  

In total, we analysed 2,107 oyster shells from 19 archaeological sites [Total sample numbers](Total%20sample%20numbers.png).

Of these analysed shells, we were able to access information regarding hinge size or biological age in 1,990 shells. For 143 shells it was not possible to determine the hinge size and for 683 it was not possible to accurately determine the biological age. The distributions across archaeological sites are shown in Figure [Total sample numbers](Total%20sample%20numbers.png) together with their respective distributions across archaeological periods and measuring type. One needs to take into consideration that the number of samples in this dataset is not correlated to the size of the midden, but are solely a result of preservation, research intensity, excavation methods, and accessibility to the authors.

  

## Sizes

Changes in size between periods was noticeable with Mesolithic Ertebølle shells having a much wider range of hinge sizes (2–34 mm) than the Neolithic Funnel Beaker shells (2–18 mm). 

The average hinge of Mesolithic shells is larger (8.3 mm) than the Neolithic ones (7.9 mm), but not significantly (Mann-Whitney U: p=0.22) and only as a result of some purely Mesolithic sites such as Hjarnø and Tybrind Vig skewing the overall values.

Comparisons between Mesolithic and Neolithic periods on site level were possible at 6 of the 19 sites. In four of these sites, the Mesolithic period shells were significantly larger than then Neolithic sites (Krabbesholm: Mann-Whitney U: p<0.01; Havnø: Mann-Whitney U: p<0.01; Eskilsø: Mann-Whitney U: p<0.01; Norsminde: Mann-Whitney U: p<0.01). In two sites there was no significant difference (Bjørnsholm: Mann-Whitney U: p=0.70; Visborg: Mann-Whitney U: p=0.91).

## Ages

We further compared biological ages between periods with significantly older oysters (Mann-Whitney U: p<0.01) in the Mesolithic period (mean=4.9 years) than the Neolithic period (mean=3.7 years).

On the site level at the six sites, we compared the periods and found a similar pattern as with the hinges, with three of the six sites showing significantly older molluscs during the Mesolithic period (Havnø: Mann-Whitney U: p<0.01; Eskilsø: Mann-Whitney U: p<0.01; Norsminde: Mann-Whitney U: p<0.01) and no significant difference in the other sites (Krabbesholm: Mann-Whitney U: p=0.08; Bjørnsholm: Mann-Whitney U: p=0.09; Visborg: Mann-Whitney U: p=0.70).

## Residuals

We established a growth curve [Methods](Methods.md) to better compare differences in growth rates at specific ages. The deviations from the growth curve show whether a shell has grown faster or slower than others of that age. This step was done to cancel out the impact that age has on the size of a shell and focus on growing conditions.

We compared these residuals across periods with significantly faster growing shells (Mann-Whitney U: p<0.01) in the Neolithic period (mean=+0.2 mm) than the Mesolithic period (mean=–0.1 mm).

On the site level at the six sites, we compared the periods and found that only two sites (Havnø and Norsminde) had significant differences between Mesolithic and Neolithic periods (Havnø: Mann-Whitney U: p<0.03;Norsminde: Mann-Whitney U: p<0.03). In both cases Mesolithic oysters grew faster than Neolithic oysters

Four of the six sites show no significant difference in growth rates across the transition (Krabbesholm: Mann-Whitney U: p=0.34; Bjørnsholm: Mann-Whitney U: p=0.86;  Visborg: Mann-Whitney U: p=0.78; Eskilsø: Mann-Whitney U: p=0.96).

## Stratigraphic levels

The above scale of analysis was suitable to compare larger trends but does not take into account that many of the sites are not easily comparable, because of their different histories of accumulation so that some periods are over- or underrepresented in the dataset.

We thus selected sites with more detailed stratigraphic information to better understand the development of oyster sizes across time and — where applicable — across the Mesolithic-Neolithic transition.

A relative weight analysis ([Methods](Methods.md)) indicated which (age or growth rate in the form of residuals) is the important factor on the oyster hinge size across the stratigraphy in percent ([Relative Importance of Growth Rate](Relative%20Importance%20of%20Growth%20Rate.png) and Table 1 below). 

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Site|Age|Residuals|
|FHM 4383 Krabbesholm II|37.29%|63%|
|FHM 2168 Ertebølle|47.18%|54%|
|FHM 5184 Hjarnø Sund|52.32%|48%|
|FHM 2911 Norsminde|52.45%|48%|
|FHM 2911 Bjørnsholm|56.11%|44%|
|MFG 158/99 Eskilsø SØ|76.94%|23%|

This importance varied between sites with some being influenced by the growth rate by up to 63% (Krabbesholm) while others showed only a small influence of the growth rate of 23%.

We also included Havnø in this analysis, which showed a strong influence of the age variable (Age 70%, Residuals 30%). However, due to the short sequence (n=3) we could not get a strong p-value in this analysis and thus removed it from the list [Methods](Methods.md).

The site FHM 4383 Krabbesholm has only one stratigraphic unit that dates into the Mesolithic, which makes comparisons between the periods difficult. 

The stratigraphic information allows to see the changes in oyster size through time. These changes are somewhat cyclical and decrease from units 14 to 10, with a subsequent increase from units 8 to 5 and again a decrease in units 4 to 2.  ^a20bf8

While some of these increases and decreases are mirrored in the age of the oysters, the average value for age remains fairly constant. Different to Milner 2013 in [Thompson & Waggoner (2013)](Victor%20D.%20Thompson,%20James%20C.%20Waggoner%20-%20The%20Archaeology%20and%20Historical%20Ecology%20of%20Small%20Scale%20Economies-University%20Press%20of%20Florida%20(2013).pdf)

With age being fairly constant, but hinge sizes changing, the growth rate also shows more pronounced changes through time.

Here something about [Discussion-changes in oyster abundance at the meso neo transition](Discussion-changes%20in%20oyster%20abundance%20at%20the%20meso%20neo%20transition.md)?

Contrary to [[2.1 Results-Krabbesholm]], [Eskilsø](Eskilsø.png) is mostly covering the Mesolithic, with only one unit representing the Neolithic.

One might argue that this is why the sites are at the respective opposites of the spectrum of [Relative Importance of Growth Rate](Relative%20Importance%20of%20Growth%20Rate.png), but other sites that are purely mesolithic plot somewhere in between, so the chronological differences between Eskilsø and [2.1 Results-Krabbesholm](2.1%20Results-Krabbesholm.md) are likely coincidental.

Eskilsø shows and increase in oyster sizes through time that peaks in F layer 2 and reaches slightly smaller sizes at the end of the deposit (B layer 10+14) than what it started as (G layer 6).

These changes are perfectly mirrored in the age-values, which also indicate that oysters were eaten at older ages than later towards the last stages of the Mesolithic and early Neolithic.

Growth rates remain fairly stable across the sequence.

The remaining sites (Ertebølle, Hjarnø, Norsminde, and Bjørnsholm) lie somewhere in between with neither age nor growth rate being the main control.

Instead, as is the case for [Ertebølle](Ertebølle.png), [Hjarnø Sund](Hjarnø.png), and [Norsminde](Norsminde.png), both age and growth rate are changing in parallel, so that human exploitation as well as environmental changes are at play.

Norsminde has an oyster to cockle transition from Meso to neo layers. The ages get younger in the Neolithic. The drop starts not immediately but rather slightly delayed. Growth rates also drop but that is a gradual change that starts in the Mesolithic.   

Hjarnø Sund also has a shift in species composition from layers 4 to 5 and above, where the percentage of cockles increased. (see [Larsen et al 2018](2018%20Larsen%20et%20al..pdf)) This could potentially be a reason for the increase of collection age in oysters. It is however unclear why there is a shift to cockles, when oysters are also growing faster.

The last site, [Bjørnsholm](Bjørnsholm.png), shows some variation in size changes but more interestingly shows age and growth rates changing in close to opposite ways.

For instance, while ages seem to increase towards the Mesolithic-Neolithic transition, growth rates are declining and only pick up again in the early Neolithic, when the age of consumption has decreased again.

# Discussion

## Prehistoric stability in oyster harvesting

Our growth rate analysis of over 2,000 oyster shells provides the first long-term and large-scale study of human oyster harvesting impacting on oyster demographics across socioeconomic and environmental transitions. Oyster harvesting stayed for the most part within a sustainable frame across the recorded ~2,000 year time period. In almost all sites (excluding [[Eskilsø]]) neither human harvesting pressure nor growth rate decline indicate a loss or a reason for abandonment of the resource.

Our quantification of the two factors influencing oyster size (harvesting pressure and growth rate) revealed that in most sites both are equally at play (Table 1). This means that environmental impacts on growth rate are not to be excluded but that the human impact is strong enough to potentially cause detrimental damage to the demography of the local oyster population. This lends further credibility to the usefulness of size-data alone, as has been employed elsewhere on a larger scale (Rick et al. 2016, Thompson et al. 2020).

One example for the impact that human harvest can have during stable growth conditions is provided by the site of [[Eskilsø]]. Here the data show a steep drop in oyster age during the Mesolithic and no sign of recovery with the start of the Neolithic at the end of the record. This is the only site where a decline in oyster size that predates the oyster-cockle-shift would provide an explanation (anthropogenic or environmental) for the change to harvesting predominantly cockles.

Each other site shows that harvesting pressure fluctuates but generally recovers.

  
  

## Abandonment of oysters

Against our expectations, our dataset does not support an increase of oyster age with the uptake of agricultural practices in Denmark. Instead oyster ages and sizes decrease from the very early layers to become stable during most of the Mesolithic Ertebølle period with little changes linked to each site's transition into the Neolithic Funnel Beaker period. 

This lack of a connection between oyster size changes and the transition to the Neolithic agrees with recent dating of the oyster-cockle-shift at the submerged site of Hjarnø Sund. Here the shift occurs at ~7500–7300 and ~7300–7200 cal BP, which is around the time of the Kongemose/Ertebølle transition and about 1,300 year prior to the Ertebølle/Funnel Beaker transition (Larsen et al. 2018). This earlier occurrence points towards local environmental changes as the main cause, that change nearshore habitats to become more suitable for cockles (and mussels) than for oysters and thus reduce the overall availability of oysters without impacting their growth rate. Given the sudden change of this transition suggests a tipping-point scenario, such as the one described by Larsen *et al.*, where sea-level related geomorphological developments of beach ridges and increased sedimentation removed the potential for young oysters to attach themselves and grow to a size worth harvesting. Such a scenario is similar to the more recent oyster bank off Helgoland, which struggled under increased sedimentation (Sander *et al.* 2021). Environmental changes such as these interrupt or rather prevent the shell growth we measured in our study, as such its impacts cannot be picked up directly by the sclerochronological methods we employed.

Interestingly, the shift to another mollusc species comes easy and it is not entirely unlikely that a shift in harvesting practice and the local communities adaptability had a big role to play in the swiftness of the transition.

## Mesolithic sedentism

With the Ertebølle period being an original part of what in Europe is described as the Mesolithic period, a period of Holocene Hunter-Fisher-Gatherers, they are grouped together with seasonally mobile communities that repeatedly visit the same spot but are not as such sedentary as is expected for agricultural communities of the Neolithic that originate from the Levant. Mobile communities might not provide an ideal comparison for sustainable long-term oyster harvesting, as it is difficult to capture their spatially extensive footprint.

In fact, size and age ranges of Mesolithic period sites were much larger than for the Neolithic. 

But these wide ranges are not representative of all Mesolithic sites. 

Indeed, there are many sites that have just as small or even smaller average sizes as the Neolithic ones. The sites that do contain large shells are either the earlier shell midden sites (e.g. Hjarnø Sund, Hjarnø Vesterhoved), or sites that may have been visited less often than their regional counterparts. E.g. Havnø and Visborg are both situated at the Mariager Fjord and within several kilometres of each other. They share similar growth rates but the Mesolithic layers of Havnø show much larger and older oyster specimens, indicating less harvesting pressure. An explanation is that the Havnø shell midden is in its earliest occupation comprised of a previously pristine or underused oyster-bed (Milner 2013). The overall stratigraphic resolution is low but with still high average shell sizes and ages one can assume that this oyster-bed was visited less frequently than others, where average ages dropped faster. 

Similarly, the Eskilsø shell midden, which in our dataset covers the Late Mesolithic and early Neolithic, but does continue to later periods in other parts of the site, has for the majority of the Mesolithic seen large size and age averages. It is also situated on an island in the Roskilde Fjord, with more central contemporaneous sites along the mainland ([Robson et al. 2021](Robsonetal.2021.pdf)), which might have been visited more frequently, so that the oyster-bed near Eskilsø would be less affected and oysters growing older between harvests.

With older oysters found at sites whose earlier layers date to the Kongemose-Ertebølle transition and sites that are lying at more remote places, one can argue that the harvesting pressure seen in the majority of Mesolithic layers is a result of consistent harvesting similar to Neolithic periods. Solely based on the footprint that local Ertebølle communities had on the oyster-beds, a limited mobility pattern seems more likely than a traditional Mesolithic mobility that operates on a seasonal basis.

These data concur with sedentary lifestyle and subsistence patterns observed at the Early Mesolithic site of Norje Sunnansund (Boethius 2017). Here, the constant and predictable fish supply, coupled with intensive, year-round fishing activities, contributed to a sedentary lifestyle. The practiced resource management mirrored pastoralist behaviour, while the massive amount of fish, evidence of storage facilities, and year-round seasonal indicators further evidence permanent coastal settlements. 

To what degree sedentary lifestyles would also infer regulated fishing management and potentially rights is unsure for the Ertebølle period. Some degree of territoriality has been discussed and goes hand in hand with the evidence of increased conflict as seen on skeletal remains (Meiklejohn et al. 1998, [Ritchie 2010](Ritchi, KC, 2010 The Ertebølle Fisheries of Denmark, 5400–4000 BC. Madison, WI: University of Wisconsin–Madison. Doctoral Thesis ), potentially linked to competition over access to prime fishing locations (Petersen 1984). Given the need for labor coordination to build and maintain stationary fishing structures, the control over these areas likely necessitated some level of structured social organisation. The continuous presence at the coastal settlements, particularly those with evidence of multiple seasons of occupation, suggest a quasi-managerial function may have been implemented to oversee fishing activities and resource distribution. It's plausible that these developments in resource management, in combination with the need to safeguard coveted fishing grounds, contributed to a heightened sense of territoriality.

Thompson et al. (2020) suggest that individual and local resource management practices would have contributed to long-term sustainability on a regional scale, similar to the sustainable use of oysters that is found in our dataset.

## European repopulation studies / (hidden conclusion) Implications for Future Oyster ecologies 

Anthropogenic pressures of the industrial period have led to a significant decline in the population of the European flat oyster in the North Sea and neighbouring regions. In response, several repopulation initiatives across Europe have emerged [(2019 Pogoda)](2019%20Pogoda.pdf). These initiatives focus on aquaculture techniques, disease management, and habitat restoration. The goal of implementing these strategies is not only to reestablish the ecological role of *O. edulis*, but also to rejuvenate the oyster industry. As previously mentioned, oysters act as biofilters, habitat providers, and food sources for various marine species. Their restoration, therefore, can significantly contribute to the health of marine ecosystems, with benefits extending to other marine resources and overall food security.

With current oyster populations being in a diminished state and many previously rich environments having been removed during the last 200 years, no substantial long-term perspective exists. While long-term ecological studies of the North sea are looking into the past, they often include anecdotal evidence from the roman period or do not go beyond the last 300 years. A lack of substantial material of oyster harvests from before the period of peak-exploitation during the 1800s, is thus a large gap in our understanding of long-term resilience of these oyster-beds.

The data we present here extends the historical record back to 7,000 years ago and spans a period of 2 millennia of near-continuous occupation. The metrics derived from these data, indicating robust patterns of harvesting methods and potential reef management strategies, significantly enhance our understanding of oyster use in the prehistoric past. Without incorporating these datasets, gaining insights into the resilience of long-term harvesting practices would have been unachievable.

Importantly, the use of prehistoric ecological data affords practical insights and metrics for restoration projects. These include selecting suitable locations, understanding the productivity of these areas in the past, and determining their capacity to support human activities. By using growth rates, we can establish expectations for annual growth of restored modern populations, providing an empirical baseline for comparison and a target to work towards. This enables more reliable planning and forecasting for the duration of restoration efforts.

Finally, this detailed examination of sustainable oyster harvests underscores the deep connections between coastal communities and oysters, further substantiating and legitimising the efforts put forth by conservation projects. It also underlines the risk of losing invaluable paleo-ecological records due to coastal erosion and rising sea levels. Moreover, it draws attention to the past destruction of shell midden deposits elsewhere in Europe, which have been exploited for agricultural purposes and are now predominantly found in damaged conditions, with many examples in Denmark and Northern Germany. This loss of ecological data archives poses a serious challenge for researchers and underscores the importance of protecting these sites.
