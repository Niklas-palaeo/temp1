1.1       Quality and pertinence of the project’s research and innovation objectives (and the extent to which they are ambitious, and go beyond the state of the art)
 
Coastal environments have played a key role in the lives of past human populations, as an economic resource, migration and trade routes, and sources of cultural identity, amongst many others. The timing and nature of coastal use, however, is strongly debated with many scholars arguing that intensive use of this environment only began during the Mid-Holocene (see for example Bailey, 2004, Erlandson, 2010, Marean, 2014, Will et al., 2019). One of the leading causes for the uncertainty is that for more than 1/3 of human history sea levels have been significantly lower than they are today, with coastlines only reaching their current positions approximately 6000-7000 years ago in Europe. Therefore, our current understandings of when and how these environments were used are, at best, skewed, or largely confined to the period following sea-level stabilisation. 
 
Growing recognition that large swathes of humanity’s history now lie underwater is spurring researchers to focus their attention on the seafloor, with studies of submerged sites and palaeolandscapes increasing in popularity over the years (Bailey et al., 2017, Bailey et al., 2020, Bailey and Flemming, 2008, Benjamin et al., 2011). Research on submerged palaeolandscapes is already reshaping our understandings of how people in the past interacted with and used coastal environments, from confirming that they lived on these now drowned landscapes (Bailey et al., 2020) to how they responded to sea-level rise (Galili et al., 2019). One site type that has been identified in recent years is submerged shell middens. 
 
Shell middens, or shell mounds, are one of the most common archaeological site types found along coastlines. Despite previous hypotheses arguing that these sites could not survive the inundation process, to date four submerged middens have been identified: two in Denmark, one in the US, and one in Japan. Archaeologists have long noted that middens can provide key understandings regarding how people utilised coasts in the past. The shells that form the bulk of these sites inform us about past dietary practices, environmental conditions, and technologies, while also providing favourable conditions for the preservation of a wide range of materials, such as stone tools, organic materials, and non-molluscan animal remains (citation). Submerged shell middens are therefore likely to be repositories of information regarding how people utilised these now drowned coastlines and hold the potential to rewrite our current understandings of coastal use in the past.
 
While middens have been studied extensively in terrestrial settings, limited research has been conducted on them in submerged contexts. Specifically, little has been done on identifying the taphonomic processes impacting submerged middens, and the biases that flow on from this. This has limited our ability to use data from these sites in reconstructions of the past.
 
This research aims to address our current gap in knowledge regarding submerged middens with two main research objectives. Research objective one will be to identify and quantify how the process and nature of submergence affects archaeological midden sites. Research objective two will be to examine how submerged midden sites contribute to reconstructions of past human behaviour.
 
 

 
Work package one
 
Research objective one can be broken down into three main questions:
 
1)    What are the taphonomic and post-depositional variables which impact submerged middens?
2)    How do these differ from their terrestrial counterparts?
3)    Do the variables impacting submerged middens differ from submerged natural shell accumulations? 
 
Middens have been studied extensively in terrestrial settings with researchers noting that a strong understanding of the taphonomic processes impacting these sites is crucial for developing meaningful reconstructions (Hammond, 2014). This recognition led to dedicated studies on different factors impacting sites including fragmentation (Gutiérrez-Zugasti, 2011), weathering and dissolution (Muckle, 1985), burning (Oertle and Szabó, 2022), and biological agents (Szabo, 2012). However, given the nascent nature of submerged midden studies similar studies have not been carried out on these site. 
 
To date, the majority of research on submerged middens has focussed on confirming that they do survive the inundation process (Astrup et al., 2021, Astrup et al., 2020, Cook Hale et al., 2019, Ward and Maksimenko, 2019, Ward et al., 2019)and locating them through geophysical prospection (Astrup et al., 2020, Garrison et al., 2013). A small body of work has been conducted to understand the micromorphology of these sites, again largely with the aim of proving that they are anthropogenic, (Hale et al., 2021, Hale et al., 2022). However, some of these micromorphological studies (e.g. Hale et al., 2022, Ward et al., 2019) have begun to document the taphonomic processes impacting these sites on a small-scale. These studies have been fundamental for proving that middens can survive the inundation process and providing base-level information regarding some of the taphonomic processes that may be impacting these sites. Comprehensive, macroscopic studies of taphonomic processes at these sites, however, are lacking.   
 
Preliminary zooarchaeological analyses on submerged middens from Denmark and the Gulf of Mexico revealed that there are a suite of taphonomic processes affecting these sites which are not observed in terrestrial sites (Astrup et al., 2021, Hale et al., 2021). Processes such as re-deposition and physical erosion of material from wave action, epizootic activity, and bioerosion from marine creatures are all unique taphonomic processes that have been recorded during preliminary examinations. However, the prevalence of these actors, and how they interact with each other, have not been recorded in detail.
 
Detailed studies of these taphonomic factors, and their influences on these assemblages are therefore essential if we are to use them effectively in reconstructions of past human behaviour. The proposed project is state of the art - it will be the first comprehensive macroscopic study of the taphonomic variables affecting submerged middens. It aims to move beyond simply assessing whether submerged middens exist to gaining a fundamental understanding of how submergence has transformed these sites, and their place in answering key archaeological questions. 
 
To achieve research objective one the faunal material from five sites from Eastern Jutland will be compared: one terrestrial Early Ertebølle midden (Vestre Strandalle); two submerged Early Ertebølle middens (Hjarnø Sund and Hjarnø Vesterhoved); one terrestrial natural shell accumulation; and one submerged natural shell accumulation. 
 
The comparison of the terrestrial and submerged shell middens will allow us to work from the known to the unknown. Each of the submerged midden sites in this study began as a terrestrial midden. By comparing the terrestrial midden with the submerged sites we can document and quantify where taphonomic processes overlap, where the act of submergence may have impacted various taphonomic signatures, be that exacerbated or halted particular variables, and where new influences which are only found in marine settings may be occurring (for example bioerosion). 
 
The comparison of archaeological and natural assemblages is proposed with the specific aim of determining whether there are unique taphonomic processes which are only seen specific contexts. Given the nature of the seafloor when studying submerged middens one of the primary issues that researchers face is identifying whether the material is natural, cultural, or a combination of both. Studies comparing natural and cultural assemblages have been conducted in terrestrial (Henderson et al., 2002, O'Connor and Sullivan, 1994, Sullivan and O'Connor, 1993) and marine settings (Hale et al., 2021, Ward et al., 2019). However, at present attempts have not been made in midden studies to compare assemblages from all four settings. 
 
This data collected from this comparative work will be used to develop a robust set of criteria that can be used to assess the state of preservation of a submerged midden site, and to identify key biases that may impact interpretations. A secondary benefit of these comparisons in it will aid in classifying key characteristics that can be used to assess other submerged shell assemblages for signs that they are anthropogenic in origin. This in turn will allow for us to produce more meaningful reconstructions from these datasets, and to use these sites to critically assess current archaeological models and questions. This list of criteria will by no means cover all the potential processes that may impact all submerged midden sites, but it will be a crucial step in the right direction for future research.  
 
All faunal material from the two submerged middens have undergone taxonomic sorting and quantification meaning that study can focus solely on document that taphonomic variables impacting them. Material from Vestre Strandalle has not been sorted at this point in time, but will be done so following the same protocols used for the submerged sites (Astrup et al., 2021).
 
 
Work package two
 
Research objective two focusses specifically on how submerged midden sites contribute to reconstructions of past human behaviour. In particular, do they differ from, or do they complement terrestrial sites from similar periods? Here I specifically seek to examine whether the submerged midden sites of Hjarnø Sund and Hjarnø Vesterhoved shift the narrative of coastal use in Eastern Jutland during the early Ertebølle period.
 
In Denmark the transition from the Kongemose to the Ertebølle during the Mesolithic is marked by distinct shifts in dietary practices, specifically an increase in the use of marine resources. This changing relationship with the ocean is one that is seen along coastlines across Europe, with there being an explosion of coastal use following sea level stabilisation during the mid-Holocene (6000-8000 years ago). The marked increase in coastal sites during this period has led to the argument that coastal use only became prominent during the mid-Holocene (Will et al., 2019). However, as noted above, this argument is based on a biased dataset, with there likely being numerous older coastal sites located on the ocean floor. 
 
The current lack of understanding surrounding the impacts of submergence on middens has largely restricted the way we use these datasets in the reconstruction of past human behaviour. The radiocarbon dates for the submerged middens at Hjarnø Sund and Hjarnø Vesterhoved places them in the Early Ertebølle period, already suggesting that we can push back the date of intensive coastal use in the region by several hundred years. However, without comprehensive taphonomic studies, we have not been able to assess how these assemblages compare to what is noted in terrestrial sites for the same period. Through the work conducted in WP1, however, we will, for the first time, be in a position to use data from submerged middens to ask meaningful questions regarding past coastal use at these sites. Furthermore, 
 
 
 
This research will push the discipline forward by being the first to compare midden assemblages from terrestrial and submerged settings, for contemporaneous periods, with the specific intent of assessing how these underwater sites fit within broader narratives for the region.
 
 
 
 
 
 
-Pretty much here I want to highlight that this research is important because it will the first attempt to do something like this and will have wider implications for further work like this in Denmark and Europe.
 
 
The proposed project will examine how middens have been impacted by the process of submergence, and how these sites can be used to reassess our current understanding of coastal use in Denmark during the early Ertebølle period in Eastern Jutland. The project can be broken into two research objectives.

While middens are composed of many different elements, the decision to focus on the faunal remains, specifically the shell, has been made as this forms the bulk of these assemblages.
The two submerged middens, Hjarnø Sund and Hjarnø Vesterhoved, were excavated in 2015 and 2018 respectively, and have both been dated to the Early Ertebølle period. The terrestrial midden, Vestre Strandalle was exca

The methodology for this project draws on principles from zooarchaeology, palaeontology, ecology and biology, chemistry, and physics. 
 
1.     Material from all five sites will be subject to basic zooarchaeological analyses. This will include taxonomic sorting and identification, and recording of material using standard measure of quantification; Minimum Number of Individuals (MNI), Number of Identified Specimens (NISP), and weight. For the two submerged middens, this processes has already been completed.
2.     Shell material will then undergo detailed taphonomic analyses to identify what variables may be impacting the preservations of these sites. Here the research will combine current understandings of taphonomy in archaeology with research conducted in the biological sciences and palaeontology to identify taphonomic processes such as chemical and physical weathering, bioerosion, burning,  
Given the volume of material to be analysed samples will
As the natural assemblages will be column samples all material for them will be subject to detailed taphonomic analyses. For the archaeological sites, given the sheer volume of material, to ensure that all sites can be analysed, 25% samples will be taken from each of these sites for the detailed taphonomic analyses.
 
Once taphonomic processes have been categorised, documented, and quantified variation
 
Data from all sites will be compared statistically to identify how similar, or dissimilar the taphonomic processes between these sites are. 
 
Preliminary examinations have already been conducted on the two submerged middens, allowing for this research to focus solely on identifying the taphonomic influences and isotopic analyses.

1.3       Quality of the supervision, training and of the two-way transfer of knowledge between the researcher and the host
 
The proposed supervisor for this topic is Associate Professor Marcello Mannino. Dr Mannino is a leading figure in zooarchaeology, particularly in the field of midden research and archaeomalacology where he has over two decades of experience. He has over 100 (107) publications, a H-index score of 23, and over 3000 citations (as of July 2022). During his research career he has conducted and written foundational research for how we conduct zooarchaeological work in coastal settings. More importantly, however, Associate Professor Mannino is one of the only archaeomalacologist in the world to have studied submerged middens being on the research team for the Hjarnø Sund site in Eastern Jutland, Denmark. In this way he is uniquely suited to supervise this research.
 
He also has extensive experience in developing and running large research projects having been the recipient and lead investigator on multiple large grants including two Leverhulme Trust grants (2002-2005 and 2005-2007), and a Marie Curie Intra-European Fellowship (2008-2010). This demonstrates that he has the skills to mentor on how to construct and run large research projects, skills which would be highly beneficial for my research career.
