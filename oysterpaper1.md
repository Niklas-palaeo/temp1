Abstract
Oysters play a pivotal role in the health and productivity of marine ecosystems. Their unique ability to filter water, provide habitat, and contribute to nutrient cycling has remained underused in many parts of Europe, following the destruction of vast oyster beds in the 19th and 20th centuries. The burgeoning field of oyster restoration for aquaculture has recognised the potential of these bivalves in promoting ecosystem resilience and enhancing biodiversity. Restoring oysters to previous levels requires the establishment of ecological baselines that ideally take into account long-term variability of the animal as well as the surrounding environment prior to significant human intervention, an extremely challenging task. This is why archaeological shell middens are invaluable baseline archives and provide exclusive insights into the state of past ecosystems.
Here we use demographic information from over 2000 analysed oyster shells dating from ~5400–3500 cal BCE, the largest archaeological growth rate dataset of molluscs yet. Through individual high-resolution analysis of size as well as ontogenetic age we decouple anthropogenic from environmental impacts over a large study region.
Our data show definitive control of oyster sizes and demography through human harvesting during the mid-Holocene. Furthermore, we present the metrics for long-term sustainable harvesting of oysters across environmental and socioeconomic transitions, providing demographic targets for current oyster restoration projects and valuable context in mitigating the impact of modern climatic change.
Introduction
Biological and economic functions of oysters
Oysters, as ecosystem engineers, are able to significantly influence the ecological dynamics and economic sustainability in coastal regions (Pogoda et al. 2019; Grabowski et al. 2012), including the European Atlantic coast and in particular estuarine areas, enhancing the seafood industry and ecotourism, offering additional revenue for local communities (Laing et al. 2006; Colsoul et al. 2021).
The pivotal role of oysters in these ecosystems is primarily due to their robust filtration capacity, serving as an organic particle and pollutant extractor. This process improves water transparency, encourages aquatic plant photosynthesis, and curbs eutrophication by limiting nitrogen and phosphorus, thereby maintaining a biologically diverse and healthy marine environment (Coen et al. 2007).
Moreover, oysters' tendency to establish reefs contributes to our understanding of ecological complexity and biodiversity by providing crucial habitats for various marine species. The physical presence of reefs also mitigates shoreline erosion and acts as a storm buffer, which is increasingly important considering modern climate change (Grabowski and Peterson 2007).
The vital ecological and economic roles of oysters necessitates strategic conservation and sustainable management efforts to preserve their ecological functions and ensure the longevity of supported human industries, thus balancing ecological health with human prosperity.
Overfishing, restoration efforts and challenges in establishing accurate baselines
Historically abundant oysters have seen considerable declines globally, due to overfishing and climate change. For instance,In particular European industrial-scale harvesting throughoutin the 19th and early 20th centuries critically reduced oyster populations of the North Sea oyster populations by 90% (see SI Appendix, Fig. S1; Lotze 2005).
The decline of oyster populations along the European Atlantic Coast has brought up significant ecological and economic concern (Gibson et al. 2007). Over the last century, these regions have faced a marked depletion of native oyster populations. Specifically, Ostrea edulis, commonly known as the European flat oyster, has experienced a dramatic decline (Pogoda 2019).
One example comes from the Wadden Sea, which is now characterised by its soft-sediment tidal flats (see SI Appendix, Fig. S1). A century ago, however, complex, three-dimensional habitats were provided by oyster banks (Lotze 2005). These diversified the Wadden Sea underwater landscape and provided diverse habitats for a variety of species which depended on hard substrates for protection or food supply, including rich communities of sponges, sea anemones, hydroids, worms, sea urchins and others species (Reise ; Möbius ). With the oysters’ depletion of oysters, the Wadden Sea ecosystem's ability to provide high water quality and complex habitats was hugely reduced, leading to the tidal flats we know today (Michaelis and Reise ; Reise 1998). Climate change has intensified these effects through elevated sea temperatures, ocean acidification, and frequent extreme weather events (Doney et al. 2012).
In light of these ecological challenges, several restoration and repopulation efforts are currently underway. Particularly, the Native Oyster Restoration Alliance (NORA) (Pogoda et al. 2019) and the European Union's Horizon 2020 program have initiated projects aimed at rebuilding the lost oyster reefs, and enhancing the population of native oysters in these regions (e.g. Stechele et al. 2023).
However, the historical and ongoing stresses have altered the modern baseline of oyster populations, meaning that the perception of a healthy oyster population is potentially based on a significantly depleted baseline (Pauly 1995; Kirby 2004). Restoration targets that enhance ecosystem functions and services, such as biodiversity, habitat complexity and water quality, are contingent upon a comprehensive understanding of oyster fisheriesy before the historical overfishing occurred.
Research on prehistoric and historic oyster fisheries
Marine ecosystems are particularly susceptible to successive environmental degradation, due to the largely unknown history of marine ecosystem change and the lack of objective standards. This can lead to a gradual acceptance of this degradation, as points of reference are forgotten or overprinted (Pauly 1995).
To address this knowledge gap, researchers are increasingly turning to palaeo-ecological, archaeological, and historical evidence (Reeder-Myers et al. 2022). These studies are revealing the timing, direction, magnitude, and drivers of change within marine ecosystems over past decades, centuries, and millennia. For example, comparing historical (1878-1935) and recent (1968-2010) records, zu Ermgassen et al. (zu Ermgassen et al. 2012) revealed a 64% decline in the extent of oyster habitats and an 88% decrease in biomass in US estuaries. Lotze (2005) summarises the historical data (1770–1930) on oyster fishing in the Wadden Sea (1770–1930) near Jutland, Denmark showing how annual oyster landings drastically increased to over 5 million in the 1860s and then dropped to only a small fraction by the 1880s until their eventual collapse by the mid-20th century. Currently the largest natural population of Ostrea edulis in the North Sea basin is found in the Limfjord of Denmark, while smaller and endangered natural populations are known in Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden (Kerckhof et al. 2018; Hayer et al. 2019).
Using surveys and extensive dating of shell middens along the Dornoch Firth and Moray Firth systems, Scotland, Fariñas-Franco et al. (2018) provide evidence for the prehistoric and historic presence of the European oyster. Their findings suggest a persistent Ostrea edulis population in these areas until the 19th century. 
Archaeological oysters also provide metric information on past ecologies (Claassen 1998). For instance, oyster sizes can be used as a proxy for examining the conditions of past coastal ecosystems and to understand the stability and resilience of oyster fisheries over time (Campbell 2008). Rick et al. (2016) used oyster shell sizes from Chesapeake Bay to show that Native American fisheries were focused on nearshore oysters and were likely harvested at a rate that was sustainable for over ∼3500 years, despite changing Holocene climatic conditions and sea-level rise. SimilarlyUsing archaeological oyster sizes, Thompson et al. (Thompson et al. 2020) concluded that oyster fisheries remained resilient with multiple stable states over the last 5000 years before the 1900s, despite demographic and socio-economic shifts.
The case studies above illustrate how archaeological information can provide an important perspective and substantial amounts of first-hand measurable information on the long-term development of oyster fishing across millennia and through changing environmental conditions.
While oyster sizes are usually implied to be mainly affected by human harvesting pressure, the caveat of environmental changes as an additional factor is also included (2016; Thompson et al. 2020; Hausmann et al. 2021). Alas, few attempts are made to quantify how much each factor (harvesting pressure and environmental changes) actually affects size (Mannino and Thomas 2002). But by adding the biological age of oysters as a measure, one can understand whether changes in their size are due to natural environmental changes or human activities (Toniello et al. 2019). Similar to tree rings, oyster shells have regular markers that help us determine their age (Milner 2001a). If we find that both small and large shells are about the same age, it might mean that changes in the environment (e.g. changes in salinity, temperature, or nutrient availability) are causing the oysters to grow more slowly and stay small. However, if we find that the oysters as a whole are getting smaller over time and are also being harvested at a younger age, it could mean that people are over-harvesting. When people harvest oysters heavily, they often take the larger, older ones or remove the younger ones before they can grow large. This results in the oyster population as a whole being both younger and smaller (Bailey and Milner 2008).
Since environmental changes have been shown to have a strong control on shellfish populations, it is crucial to quantify their influence, when using their palaeo-ecological information to determine a long-term baseline. For instance, Toniello et al. (Toniello et al. 2019) used the ages and growth rates of 124 butter clams (Saxidomus gigantea) to investigate the historical ecology of these species in the Salish Sea, British Columbia, integrating archaeological, palaeoecological, and contemporary ecological records spanning 11,500 years. The study revealed that the sizes and lifespans of these clams increased over time owing to favourable environmental conditions and human cultivation practices, but posited that the clams in the present day are less productive due to altered habitats and the absence of traditional practices.
Being able to decouple both factors in the interpretation of oyster size further improves our understanding of the sustainable use of oyster beds by pre-industrial coastal populations and emphasises their role as ecological archives in the guidance of modern economic uses of oysters.
Long-term demographic data
Here we present a comprehensive summary of the largest archaeological demographic dataset of molluscs to date, featuring data from over 2000 oyster specimens and spanning a ~2000 year period (~5400–3500 cal BCE; calibrated years before present). The dataset covers 19 archaeological sites across Denmark (Fig. 1), including areas where wild oysters are still available, as well as areas where prehistoric coastlines have now been submerged. For each shell we aimed to determine the size as well as its age at death through sclerochronology, providing us with the additional measure of its growth rate (see Methods).

Fig. 1. The archaeological sites sampled in this study, including those with Late Mesolithic (circle) or Late Mesolithic and Early Neolithic (square) oysters (base-map by Vemaps, https://vemaps.com/denmark/dk-05).
In addition to its wide spatial character, the dataset covers environmental fluctuations occurring during the mid-Holocene and socioeconomic shifts in the form of the Mesolithic to Neolithic transition. Our dataset covers the Late Mesolithic Ertebølle culture, which was distributed across present-day Denmark, parts of northern Germany and southern Sweden (Price 2015). This period is characterised by semi-sedentary hunter-gatherer-fishers, with communities living along dynamic coastlines and specialising on the exploitation of marine resources. The Ertebølle culture is best represented by the numerous shell middens, large accumulations of shell debris interspersed with settlement refuse, including for instance, antler, bone and stone tools, ceramics, faunal and botanical remains as well as structures, such as dwellings, hearths and pits (Andersen 2000). Transitioning into the Neolithic period at ~3900 cal BCE, the Funnel Beaker culture became widespread across much of Northern Europe, including present-day Denmark, Germany, and parts of Sweden, and as far east as the Vistula River in Poland. Named after the characteristic shape of their pottery, this culture marked the advent of farming in Denmark. AlEven though marine resources, including shellfish, continued to be exploited, there was a noticeable shift towards agricultural practices and animal husbandry and crop cultivation (Gron and Rowley-Conwy 2017). 
Our dataset also covers dynamic environmental conditions with changes in sea-level, water-inflow from the North to the Baltic Sea, and marine transgressions which likely impacted oyster populations. During the mid-Holocene, oysters were eventually replaced by common cockles (Cerastoderma edule) and blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) among other taxa (Lewis et al. 2016; Larsen et al. 2018), which is why this phenomenon is often called the “oyster-to-cockle” shift. Alongside environmental changes, cultural reasons for the shift as well as overwhelming harvesting pressure on oysters have also been suggested (Milner 2002; Milner 2005), since at many sites it occurs at the Mesolithic to Neolithic transition.
Our study aimed to investigate the dynamics of oyster populations and to quantify the influence of age and environmental factors. We hypothesised that the Early Neolithic period, characterised by an increased reliance on an agricultural subsistence economy and reduced harvesting pressure, would lead to an increase in the age of oysters. Furthermore, we would expect to observe a decrease in oyster sizes preceding the oyster-to-cockle shift at the Mesolithic-Neolithic transition. This reduction in size may then be best explained as representing either harvesting pressure or environmental changes. 
We discovered compelling evidence of the long-term stability of sustainable oyster harvesting practices at almost all sites. Our findings also revealed that, on average, age accounted for approximately half of the variability in oyster size. Surprisingly, we did not observe a visible change in oyster growth rates prior to or during the oyster-to-cockle shift. However, we did identify a size shift potentially related to harvesting pressure in the earliest Ertebølle layers from which populations did not subsequently recover. We argue that this persistent pressure provides broad evidence for sedentism during the Late Mesolithic period.
Our study reveals the intricate relationship between oyster age, environmental factors, and the sustainability of oyster harvesting practices. These findings contribute to our understanding of the historical dynamics of oyster populations and can inform conservation strategies for maintaining healthy oyster beds in the future.
Most importantly, this work highlights the importance of growth rates in pre-industrial datasets that can inform research regarding the long-term stability and sustainability of mollusc harvesting.
Results
In total, we analysed 2107 oyster shells from 19 archaeological sites. Of these analysed shells, we obtained data on were able to access information regarding hinge size and/or biological age in 1990 shells (see Table 1). For 143 shells it was not possible to measuredetermine the hinge size and for 683 it was not possible to accurately determine the biological age. The distributions across the archaeological sites are shown in SI Appendix, Fig. S2A together with their respective distributions across archaeological periods and measurementing type (SI Appendix, Fig. S2B). The number of samples is not correlated to the size of each sampled site, but are solely a result of preservation, research intensity, excavation methods, and accessibility to the authors.

Sizes
Changes in size between periods was noticeable with Late Mesolithic Ertebølle shells having a much wider range of hinge sizes (2–34 mm) than the Early Neolithic Funnel Beaker shells (2–18 mm) (Fig. 2A). This translates into shell lengths of ~1.5–14.0 cm (mean: 7.5 cm, median: 7.1 cm) for the Late Mesolithic and ~1.5–10.9 cm (mean: 7.4 cm, median: 7.3 cm) for the Early Neolithic shells.
The average hinge size of the Late Mesolithic shells is larger (8.3 mm) than the Early Neolithic ones (7.9 mm) (Fig. 2A), but not significantly (Mann-Whitney U: p=0.22) and only as a result of some ‘purely’ Late Mesolithic sites such as Hjarnø skewing the overall values (see Fig. 2B).
Comparisons between the periods on a site level were possible at six of the 19 sites (Fig. 2B). At four of these sites, the Late Mesolithic shells were significantly larger than those from the Early Neolithic deposits (Krabbesholm II: Mann-Whitney U: p<0.01; Havnø: p<0.01; Eskilsø: p<0.01; Norsminde: p<0.01). At two sites there was no significant difference (Bjørnsholm: Mann-Whitney U: p=0.70; Visborg: p=0.91) to be found (Fig. 2B).

Stars (*) indicate significant differences between Late Mesolithic and Early Neolithic distributions following Mann-Whitney U tests with increasing significance for each additional star (* = p < 0.05, ** = p < 0.01, *** = p < 0.001), `ns` indicates no significant difference.
Ages 
We further compared biological ages between periods indicating significantly older oysters (Mann-Whitney U: p<0.01) in the Late Mesolithic (mean: 4.9 years, median: 3.0 years) than the Early Neolithic (mean: 3.7 years, median: 3.0) (Fig. 2C).
On the site level at the six sites, which span the Mesolithic and Neolithic, we compared the periods (Fig. 2D) and found a similar pattern as with the hinges, with three of the six sites having significantly older oysters during the Late Mesolithic (Havnø: Mann-Whitney U: p<0.01; Eskilsø: p<0.01; Norsminde: p<0.01) and no significant difference at the other sites (Krabbesholm II: Mann-Whitney U: p=0.08; Bjørnsholm: p=0.09; Visborg: p=0.70).
Residuals
We established a growth curve (see Materials and Methods; SI Appendix, Fig. S3) to better compare differences in growth rates at specific ages. The deviations from the growth curve (Fig. 3A) in the form of residuals show whether a shell has grown faster or slower than others of that age (Fig. 3B). This was undertaken to remove the impact biological age has on the size of the shell so as to focus on growing conditions alone.

Measured in mm distance from the growth curve at the time of death with negative values indicating smaller than usual shells and positive values indicating larger than usual shells. Stars (*) indicate significant differences between Late Mesolithic and Early Neolithic distributions following Mann-Whitney U tests, `ns` indicates no significant difference.
We compared these residuals across periods (Fig. 3C) with significantly faster growing shells (Mann-Whitney U: p<0.01) in the Early Neolithic (mean: +0.2 mm) than the Late Mesolithic (mean: –0.1 mm) (Fig. 3C).
On the site level at the six sites covering both the Mesolithic and Neolithic, we compared the periods and found that only two sites (Havnø and Norsminde) had significant differences between the Late Mesolithic and the Early Neolithic (Havnø: Mann-Whitney U: p<0.03; Norsminde: p<0.03). In both cases Late Mesolithic oysters grew faster than the Early Neolithic oysters.
Four of the six sites show no significant difference in growth rates across the transition (Krabbesholm II: Mann-Whitney U: p=0.34; Bjørnsholm: p=0.86; Visborg: p=0.78; Eskilsø: p=0.96).
Stratigraphic levels
The above scale of analysis was suitable to compare larger trends but does not take into account that many of the sites are not easily comparable, because of their different histories of accumulation so that some periods are over- or underrepresented in the dataset.
We thus selected sites with more detailed stratigraphic information to better understand the development of oyster sizes across time and — where applicable — across the Mesolithic-Neolithic transition.
A relative weight analysis (see Materials and Methods) indicated which factor (age or growth-rate) is the controlling factor on the oyster hinge size across the stratigraphy in percent (Fig. 4 and Table 2).

This control varied between sites with some being influenced by the growth rate by up to 63% (Krabbesholm II) while others showed only a small influence of the growth rate of 23%. 
The shell midden site of Krabbesholm II possesses a single stratigraphic unit dating to the Late Mesolithic, making comparisons between the two periods difficult. Despite this limitation, the stratigraphic data allowed us to track temporal variations in oyster size (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, these fluctuations appear to follow a somewhat cyclical pattern, with oyster sizes diminishing from units 14 to 10, then enlarging from units 8 to 5, and finally decreasing again from units 4 to 2. At the same time, the ages of the oysters also exhibit certain increases and decreases; however, the average age remains relatively stable, contrasting with the findings of Milner 2013. This stability in age, juxtaposed with variations in hinge sizes, indicates that growth rates undergo more pronounced changes over time.

Fig. 5A. Stratigraphic sequence of hinge, age and residual data at Krabbesholm II. Late Mesolithic (#16) and Early Neolithic (#2–15) layers are shown in green and blue respectively. 
Contrary to Krabbesholm II, the layers at Eskilsø mostly cover the Late Mesolithic, with only one unit representing the Early Neolithic (Fig. 5B). One might argue that this is why the sites are at the respective opposites of the spectrum of the relative importance of growth rate, but other sites that are ‘purely’ Late Mesolithic in date plot somewhere in between, so the chronological differences between Eskilsø and Krabbesholm II are likely coincidental.

Fig. 5B. Stratigraphic sequence of hinge, age and residual data at Eskilsø. Late Mesolithic (#B10+14) and Early Neolithic (#C11, F2, D12, E, A and G6) layers are shown in blue and green respectively.
At the Eskilsø shell midden, there is a notable increase in oyster sizes over time (peaking in layer F2) and subsequently diminishing slightly by the end of the deposit (layer B10+14), compared to the initial sizes (layer G6). This trend is mirrored precisely in the age data, suggesting that oysters were consumed at more advanced ages earlier in time, with this pattern changing in the latter stages of the Late Mesolithic and Early Neolithic. Throughout this sequence, growth rates exhibit relative stability.
In contrast, the other sites in the study with more detailed chronologies, namely Ertebølle, Hjarnø, Norsminde, and Bjørnsholm, demonstrate a different dynamic wherein neither age nor growth rate is the primary determinant. Specifically, at Ertebølle, Hjarnø Sund, and Norsminde, both age and growth rate undergo simultaneous changes, indicating that both human exploitation and environmental shifts are influencing the oysters.
At Norsminde, there is a transition from oysters to cockles from the Late Mesolithic to Early Neolithic. Interestingly, people exploited oysters at a younger age in the Early Neolithic. This decline does not occur abruptly but is slightly delayed. The growth rates also experience a decline, which is gradual and begins in the Late Mesolithic.
Hjarnø Sund experiences a change in species composition from layers 4 to 5 and above, with an increased proportion of cockles, as highlighted in Larsen et al. 2018. This shift may explain the increased collection age of oysters. However, the reason for this transition to cockles remains ambiguous, especially considering that oysters were experiencing accelerated growth.
Lastly, the Bjørnsholm shell midden exhibits some fluctuations in size, but more intriguingly, the age and growth rates change in nearly inverse directions. Specifically, ages tend to rise as the Mesolithic-Neolithic transition approaches, while growth rates decline. Growth rates begin to recover in the Early Neolithic, coinciding with a reduction in the mean age.
We also included the Havnø shell midden in this analysis, which showed a strong influence of the age variable (Age 70%, Residuals 30%). However, due to the short sequence (n=3) resulting in a weak p-value, we removed it from further analysis (see Materials and Methods). Havnø does however exhibit a steep decline in oyster size and age, starting high in the Late Mesolithic and finishing at a diminished level in the Early Neolithic.
Discussion
Prehistoric stability in oyster harvesting
Our growth rate analysis of over 2000 oyster shells reveals that oyster harvesting stayed for the most part within a sustainable frame across the recorded ~2000 year time period. At almost all sites (excluding Eskilsø) neither human harvesting pressure nor growth rate decline indicate a loss or a reason for abandonment of the resource.
Our quantification of the two factors influencing oyster size (harvesting pressure and growth rate) revealed that at most sites both are equally at play (Table 2). This means that environmental impacts on growth rate are not to be excluded but that the human impact is strong enough to potentially cause detrimental damage to the demography of the local oyster population. This lends further credibility to the usefulness of size-data alone, without taking into account individual ages, as has been employed elsewhere on a larger scale (2016; Thompson et al. 2020).
One example of the impact that human harvest can have during stable growth conditions is provided by the site of Eskilsø. Here the data show a steep drop in oyster age during the Late Mesolithic and no sign of recovery with the start of the Neolithic at the end of the record. This is the only site where a decline in oyster size predating the oyster-to-cockle shift can best be explained by an anthropogenic influence, resulting in a change to harvesting predominantly cockles. At each of the other sampled sites harvesting pressure fluctuates but generally recovers.
Abandonment of oysters
Against our expectations, our dataset does not support an increase of oyster age with the introduction of agriculture in Denmark. Instead oyster ages and sizes decrease from the earliest part of the Ertebølle culture and become stable throughout most of the period with little changes linked to each site's transition to the Neolithic (Milner 2013). 
The lack of a connection between oyster size changes and the Neolithic transition agrees with recent dating of the oyster-to-cockle shift at the submerged site of Hjarnø Sund. Here the shift occurs between ~5500–5300 and ~5300–5200 cal BCE, which is around the time of the transition from the Middle Mesolithic Kongemose culture to the Late Mesolithic Ertebølle culture and around 1300 years prior to the Mesolithic-Neolithic transition (Larsen et al. 2018). This earlier occurrence points towards local environmental changes as the main cause, which change nearshore habitats to become more suitable for cockles (and mussels) than for oysters and thus reduce the overall availability of oysters without impacting on their growth rates. The sudden change of this transition suggests a tipping-point scenario, such as the one described by Larsen et al., where sea-level related geomorphological developments of beach ridges and increased sedimentation removed the potential for young oysters to attach themselves and grow to a size worth harvesting. Such a scenario is similar to the more recent oyster bank off Helgoland, northern Germany which struggled under increased sedimentation (Sander et al. 2021). Environmental changes such as these interrupt or rather prevent the shell growth we identified in this study, therefore its impacts cannot be picked up directly by the sclerochronological methods we employed. Interestingly, the shift to another mollusc species seems to have happened effortlessly and it is not entirely unlikely that a shift in harvesting practice and the local communities’ adaptability had a big role to play in the swiftness of the transition.
Late Mesolithic sedentism
The Ertebølle culture is considered a hallmark of the Mesolithic period in Europe, characterised by mid-Holocene hunter-gatherer-fisher communities. It is generally assumed that these communities were seasonally mobile, frequently returning to the same locations but did not establish permanent settlements, unlike the sedentary agricultural communities of the Neolithic. One might argue that mobile communities would not provide an ideal case-study for examining the sustainability ofle long-term oyster harvesting, as it is difficult to capture their spatially extensive footprint. In fact, size and age ranges of Mesolithic period sites were much larger than those of the Neolithic. But these wide ranges are not representative of all Mesolithic sites. Indeed, there are many sites that have just as small or even smaller average sizes as Neolithic ones. The sites that do contain large shells are either the earlier shell midden sites (e.g. Hjarnø Sund, Hjarnø Vesterhoved), or sites that may have been visited less often than their regional counterparts that were more centrally accessible (i.e. not located on an island, for instance Eskilsø, Havnø, Hjarnø Sund and Hjarnø Vesterhoved).
At Hjarnø Sund, the earliest layers date to the Kongemose–-Ertebølle period and could point to a period when people were more mobile. Examples for later but less frequently visited sites are Havnø and Visborg. They are both situated in the Mariager Fjord within several kilometres of each other and share similar growth rates. But the Late Mesolithic layers of Havnø have much larger and older oysters specimens. One explanation is that during the earliest occupation at the Havnø shell midden, a pristine or underused oyster-bed was present near to the site (Milner 2013), which experienced less harvesting pressure as it was visited less frequently than others, where average ages dropped faster.
Similarly, large mean ages and sizes were evident during the Late Mesolithic at the Eskilsø shell midden. , which in our dataset covers the Late Mesolithic toand Early Neolithic, but does continue to be used during later periods in other parts of the site, has for the majority of the Late Mesolithic seen large size and age averages. The site It is also situated on an island in Roskilde Fjord, whilewith more central contemporaneous sites were located along the mainland (Robson et al. 2021). Since they, which might have been visited more frequently, so that the oyster bed near Eskilsø would have been less affected, allowing and oysters towould grow older between harvests.
With older oysters found at sites whose earlier layers date to the Kongemose-Ertebølle transition and sites that are positioned at more remote places, one can argue that the harvesting pressure seen in the majority of the Late Mesolithic layers is a result of consistent harvesting similar to the Early Neolithic. Solely based on the footprint that local Ertebølle communities had on the oyster beds, a limited mobility pattern seems more likely than a traditional Mesolithic mobility system that operates on a seasonal basis.
These data align with evidence elsewhere for a sedentary lifestyle and subsistence economy, for instance the Early Mesolithic site of Norje Sunnansund, Sweden (Boethius et al. 2020). Here, the constant and predictable fish supply, coupled with intensive, year-round fishing activities, contributed to a sedentary lifestyle. The practised resource management mirrorsed pastoralists’ behaviour, while the large amount of fish, evidence of storage facilities, and year-round seasonal indicators is further evidence of permanent coastal settlements. 
Given the sedentary lifestyles, processes for regulating fishing management and potentially fishing/shellfishing rights could be inferred for the Ertebølle period. Some degree of territoriality has been discussed and goes hand in hand with the evidence of increased trauma on human skeletal remains (Meiklejohn et al. ; Ritchie 2010)), potentially linked to competition over access to prime fishing locations (Petersen 1984). Given the need for labour coordination to build and maintain stationary fishing structures, the control over these areas likely necessitated some level of structured social organisation. Continuous presence at some of the coastal settlements, particularly those with evidence of multiple seasons of occupation, argues for a quasi-managerial function that may have been implemented to oversee fishing activities and resource distribution. It is plausible that these developments in resource management, in combination with the need to safeguard coveted fishing grounds, contributed to a heightened sense of territoriality. Thompson et al. (Thompson et al. 2020) suggest that individual and local resource management practices would have contributed to long-term sustainability on a regional scale, similar to the sustainable use of oysters that is found in our dataset.
European repopulation studies / Implications for future oyster ecologies
Anthropogenic pressures in the industrial period have led to a significant decline in the population of Ostrea edulis in the North Sea and neighbouring regions. In response, several repopulation initiatives across Europe have emerged (Pogoda 2019). These initiatives focus on aquaculture techniques, disease management, and habitat restoration. The goal of implementing these strategies is not only to reestablish the ecological role of Ostrea edulis, but also to rejuvenate the fishery. As previously mentioned, oysters act as biofilters, habitat providers, and food sources for various marine species. Their restoration , therefore, can therefore significantly contribute to the health of marine ecosystems, with benefits extending to other marine resources and overall food security.
NORA (Native Oyster Restoration Alliance) in particular, has undertaken various initiatives across Europe, including the UK and the Baltic Sea region (Pogoda et al. 2019). These initiatives encompass breeding programs, oyster bed restoration projects, and disease management strategies, seeking to rebuild self-sustaining populations of the oyster across its former range. These initiatives underscore the importance of a multidisciplinary approach that combines ecological, social, and economic aspects to restore populations effectively. It is crucial to continue such endeavours to halt and reverse the decline of populations in these historically important regions, ensuring the sustainability of these ecosystems and the industries they support.
With current oyster populations being in a diminished state and many previously rich environments having been removed during the last 200 years, no substantial long-term perspective exists. While long-term ecological studies of the North Sea are looking to the past, they rarely go beyond the last 200 years. A lack of substantial material of oyster harvests from before the period of peak-exploitation during the 1800s, is thus a large gap in our understanding of long-term resilience of these oyster-beds.
The data presented here extends the historical record back to 7000 years ago and spans a period of around two millennia of near-continuous occupation. The metrics derived from these data, indicating robust patterns of harvesting methods and potential reef management strategies, significantly enhance our understanding of oyster use in the prehistoric past. Without incorporating these datasets, gaining insights into the resilience of long-term harvesting practices would have been unachievable.
Importantly, the use of prehistoric ecological data affords practical insights and metrics for restoration projects. These include selecting suitable locations, understanding the productivity of these areas in the past, and determining their capacity to support human activities. By using growth rates, we can establish expectations for annual growth of restored modern populations, providing an empirical baseline for comparison and a target to work towards. This enables more reliable planning and forecasting for the duration of restoration efforts.
Finally, this detailed examination of sustainable oyster harvests underscores the deep connections between coastal communities and oysters, further substantiating and legitimising the efforts put forth by conservation projects. It also underlines the risk of losing invaluable palaeoecological records due to coastal erosion and rising sea levels. Moreover, it draws attention to the past destruction of shell midden deposits elsewhere in Europe, which have been exploited for agricultural purposes and are now predominantly found in damaged conditions, with many examples in Denmark and Northern Germany. This loss of ecological archives poses a serious challenge for researchers and underscores the importance of protecting these sites.
Materials and Methods
Materials
The results obtained from 513 oyster samples are presented here for the first time, complementing ‘legacy data’ on 1495 samples (Milner 2001b, Milner 2002, Milner 2013, Milner and Laurie 2006, Milner and Laurie 2009), which was re-analysed (Robson 2015, Robson et al. 2021). The overall dataset represents 2107 oysters from 19 archaeological sites, primarily shell middens, located across Denmark (Fig. 1). Based on radiocarbon (14C) dates and typo-chronologies of material culture (e.g. lithics and the presence/absence of ceramics), the sites date from the late 6th to the middle of the 4th millennium cal BCE (SI Appendix, Table S1). 
To supplement previous studies, we targeted oysters from some of the earliest Ertebølle sites in Denmark (e.g. FHM 5184 Hjarnø Sund and FHM 5948 Hjarnø Vesterhoved). Furthermore, we sampled opportunistically such as at the site of Ertebølle (VMÅ 2815), near to the eponymous shell midden in the Limfjord. Infrastructure-based development enabled us to sample a previously unknown shell midden in the Bay of Aarhus (FHM 6218 Vestre Strandalle), while renewed excavations at the Visborg (ÅHM 6814) shell midden in 2017-2018 by several of the authors, enabled us to excavate four column samples for a more targeted approach. Lastly, we expanded our sample size from one of the most renowned submerged sites in Denmark, Tybrind Vig (FHM 2033) since it was unclear whether we were dealing with a natural shell deposit/death assemblage, a redeposited or in situ shell midden from a preliminary study (Robson 2015).
Hinge measurements
The hinge of each oyster was measured with electronic callipers in mm to one decimal place (Robson 2015). In total, 2008 measurements were obtained from oyster shells from 19 coastal and shell midden sites throughout Denmark (Fig. 1 and SI Appendix, Table S1). 
Incremental growth line analysis for obtaining age
In total, 2077 oyster shells were thin sectioned following slight modification (see Robson 2015) of the method set out by Milner (2001a). Briefly, oysters were cut from tip of the hinge at a right angle to the growth lines using a Buehler ISOMET 1000 Precision Saw (Model 11-2180), and a Buehler Diamond Wafering Blade (Series 15LC Diamond No 11-4276). Then, the samples were embedded in resin (Buehler Epo-Thin Low Viscosity Epoxy Resin No 20-8140-12B and Buehler Epo-Thin Low Viscosity Epoxy Hardener No 20-8142-016), and vacuum impregnated using Buehler Vacuum Impregnation Equipment (Model No 20-1384-220). Once set, the samples were lightly ground using a range of metallographic grit papers (P600, P1200 and P2500 grades respectively) using a Buehler Motorpol 2000 Grinder/Polisher, and polished using a Texmet polishing cloth and Buehler MetaDi 3 μm water based diamond paste. They were bonded to a glass slide using Loctite 322 Adhesive, and then the body of the ‘resin block’ was sliced from the slide using a Buehler ISOMET 1000 Precision Saw, leaving a ‘thin section’ of the resin block and shell of ~50 to 100 μ in thickness. The thin sections were lightly ground by the methods described above, until a thickness of ~10 to 25 μ was achieved. 
Examining the thin sections
The thin sections were examined under polarised light at magnifications of x10 to x40, and the ages were recorded.
Hinge-to-size conversion
The study reconstructed the size of Ostrea edulis using measurements of oyster hinges from archaeological shell midden sites. Oyster hinge size is a useful proxy-value for total size (Milner 2002) and allows for specimens that are not preserved in their entirety to be included in the analysis, because hinges are usually better preserved due to their denser structure. However, we do estimated the total length (Fig. S3), which was based on empirical information in Milner (2002), which resultinged in the equation of:
length = 35.4 * log(hinge)
with measurements for hinge and length both in mm.
Estimating growth rates
Oyster hinge size was compared with the biological age of the individual mollusc, which was determined using the sclerochronological methods described above, and with their individual deviation from a standardised growth curve. This deviation allowed us to better compare shells' growth rates at different ages, since growth is not linear. The general growth curve is based on length-at-age data, including all readable shells. The individual growth rate values were then compared to the general growth curve. Tand the respective residuals at their time of death were then used to compare between specimens and across layers or sites.
Statistical analysis was performed using R, the [[code]] is available at this repository, and makes use of specifically multiple regression analysis and relative weight analysis.
Multiple regression analysis and relative weight analysis was carried out to better evaluate the influence of age and growth rate. The multiple regression analysis included the use of standardised coefficients and indicated sites with too short sequences to provide reliable samples sizes (i.e. Havnø and the four column samples at Visborg). 
We also carried out tests for Multicollinearity using Variance Inflation Factors (VIFs), which showed minimal inflation for all factors.
